# A Basic Stealer ðŸŒŸ

Hey, this is a quite simple/basic Stealer made in python that steals passwords on all chronium browsers.


# How to start?

Just install it and run it yourself to test it.                                                                                      
If you run it yourself and it doesn't work, Make sure its a '.py file' and if not copy the code, paste it in Notepad and then save it as Anything.py (The Notepad I made would be perferred as I used it to make it).


# Safety

This was to prove how terrible window's security is.                                                                                                                    
*PLEASE USE THIS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND NOT MALICIOUS PURPOSES*


# How does it work?

If your a coder living under a rock, and didn't know, chrome and other chronium based browsers save passwords in appdata or temp
which they also encrypt so nobody can view them but what this does is that it steals the data and then decrypts it.
